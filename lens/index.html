            Pinhole projections are so easy to make
            that pinholes are often discovered when people notice their projections:

            To understand how to make images with pinholes,
            we have to look at how light reflects off objects.
            In general, when light rays hit an object,
            they bounce off in many directions:
            <img class="img" src="img/diffuse.svg" />
            If we lay out a photographic film,
            light rays from any point can hit many parts of the film.
            </p> <p>
            A pinhole camera works
            by imposing order on the light that passes through it.
            They make it so that only light coming from one direction
            can only hit a small part of the film:
            <img class="img" src="img/pinhole.svg" />
            </p> <p>
            The good news is that this produces an image.
            The bad news is that we now block most of the light in the scene.
            so we need to wait a long time to collect enough light to form an image.
            This is fine for landscapes,
            where you can set your camera on a tripod and leave it for an hour.
            This is less fine for moving subjects like cats or F1 cars.
            </p> <p>
            But what if, instead of blocking these rays
            that are headed for the wrong part of the film,
            we could bend them back in the right direction?
            <img class="img" src="img/lens.svg" />
            This is what a lens tries to do.
            An ideal lens projects light like a pinhole,
            but lets you collect all the light that hits its area.
